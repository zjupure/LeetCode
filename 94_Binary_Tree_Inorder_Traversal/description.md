###Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree `{1,#,2,3}`,

>   1
>    \
>     2
>    /
>   3

return `[1,3,2]`.

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

confused what `"{1,#,2,3}"` means? [> read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/#)
